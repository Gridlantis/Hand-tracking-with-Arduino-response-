# Hand-tracking-with-Arduino-response-
This project is a basic hand tracking interface using TensorFlow and Mediapipe with Three.js for 3d rendering through an html interface.  This system analyzes real time movments and gestures to trigger reponses and relay them to the arduino microcontroller. This prompts an LED light to flash in the circuit.
