# Hand-tracking-with-Arduino-response-
 This project is a basic hand tracking interface using TensorFlow and Mediapipe with Three.js for 3d rendering through an html interface.  This system analyzes real-time movements and gestures to trigger responses and relay them to the Arduino microcontroller. This prompts an LED light to flash in the circuit. This project integrates the functions of an HTML interface, 3d rendering, motion, and gesture tracking, along with the workflow between gesture recognition and physical responses
